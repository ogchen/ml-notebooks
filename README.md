# Machine Learning Algorithms
This repo contains a range of Jupyter Notebooks which play around with some of the algorithms as described in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop. Some accompanying notes can be found [here on notion.so](https://www.notion.so/01c2143b437e4779ae146f15fa5bb0e0?v=6c9852f02e53489ea85b5057c2d3894c).
